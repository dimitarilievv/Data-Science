        "The Water Potability dataset contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. The dataset includes ten attributes, each providing valuable information about water characteristics. These attributes encompass pH value, hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), chloramines, sulfate concentration, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and the target variable, potability. pH value is crucial for assessing the acidâ€“base balance, while hardness indicates the presence of calcium and magnesium salts. TDS measures the mineral content, chloramines are disinfectants, sulfate is a natural substance found in minerals, conductivity indicates water's ability to conduct electric current, organic carbon measures carbon in organic compounds, and trihalomethanes are chemicals found in chlorine-treated water. Turbidity assesses the quantity of solid matter in suspended state. The target variable, 'Potability,' is binary (1 for potable and 0 for not potable), indicating whether water is safe for human consumption."
