    "## The Vacation Preferences Dataset\n",
    "The dataset contains information about individuals and their vacation preferences. It includes details such as age, gender, income, and education level. It also provides insights into their vacation habits, like the number of vacations taken each year, preferred activities (such as hiking, swimming, skiing, or sunbathing), and their budget for vacations. Other information includes the type of place they live in (urban, suburban, or rural), how far they live from mountains and beaches, and their favorite season for vacations (summer, winter, spring, or fall). The dataset also contains information whether they have pets and if they are concerned about the environment. All these features serve as input variables for predictive modeling. The 'Preference' attribute serves as the target variable, where 1 represents preference for mountains, 0 for beaches."
