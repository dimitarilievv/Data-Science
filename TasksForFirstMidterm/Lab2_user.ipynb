    "## Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset\n",
    "The dataset contains detailed information on 700 mobile device users, capturing various usage patterns and behavior classifications. The features include app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, data consumption, and more. These metrics provide insights into the user's daily interactions with their device, such as how much time is spent on apps, the amount of screen activity, battery usage, and mobile data consumption. In addition, user demographics like age and gender are included, as well as the device model and operating system. The 'user behavior class' attribute categorizes users based on their usage patterns, ranging from light to extreme behavior. All features, except for the 'user behavior class', can be used as input variables for analysis and modeling, while the 'user behavior class' serves as the target variable for prediction. This dataset offers valuable insights for studying mobile user behavior and can be used for building predictive models in the domain of mobile technology and applications."
